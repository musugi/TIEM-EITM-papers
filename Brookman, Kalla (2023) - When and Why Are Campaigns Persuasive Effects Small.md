#### 0. Introduction


#### 1. Elements of Framework
#### Theory
**Targets of Model**: 

**Similarities of Model to the Target**: N/A

**Model**: Campaign effect in
- Partisan Intoxication Interpretation
- Quasi-Bayesian Interpretation
- Theories of Priming

**Implication**: N/A

#### Empirical/Elements of Research Design (ERD)
**Targets of Research Design**: 
#### Empirical Strategy
**Estimand**: 

**Data**: 

**Statistical Procedure**: 

#### Measurement Validity
**Interpretation**: 
- Able to conduct comparisons within the same electoral context

**Argument**:

#### Substantive Identification
**Assumption**:
- Small effect found on Trump side represents genuine persuasion

**Arguments**:
- Retesting the statements estimated to have the largest effects in a first round of data collection completely regresses to the mean in a subsequent round of data collection.

#### Estimates
- Messages about the candidate with weaker prior belief (Biden) have significantly larger effects on stated vote choice.
- Even voters with strong prior beliefs about Trump change their opinion to a small degree.
    -> Distinguish: findings that nonzero effect for stronger prior belief type is consistent with informational interpretation (not true in intoxication interpretation model)
- The persuasion documented results to a great extent from voters crossing party lines
    -> Distinguish: inconsistent with intoxication interpretation model (e.g. Republicans are persuaded to vote for Biden after pro-Biden information)
- Voters are more persuaded when exposed to campaign messages that contain richer informational content.
    -> Distinguish: consistent with the manner in informational intepretation model
- Voters change their views of Trump's performance in specific domain, yet failed to change the global evaluation of him
    -> Distinguish: inconsistent with intoxication interpretation model where voters resist information contrary to their partisan identities

#### 5. Distinguishing
- Distinguish between the informational/quasi-Bayesian interpretation and partisan intoxication
