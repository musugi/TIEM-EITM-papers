#### 0. Introduction
##### The research stems from the inquiry on whether the formation of political beliefs and the decision on participating in the election come from personal economic circumstances. Hall thought this from the context of property ownership. 

#### 1. Elements of Framework
##### Theory
##### - **Targets of Model**: 
-
##### - **Similarities of Model to the Target**: Discuss how well the model aligns with the theoretical target.
- 
##### - **Model**: Outline the key aspects of the model under discussion.
- 
##### - **Implication**: Explain the implications derived from the model.
- 

#### Empirical/Elements of Research Design (ERD)
##### Targets of Research Design 
- voter turnout/participation difference between voter with and without homeownership
##### Empirical Strategy
##### - **Estimand**: Define the parameter of interest.
##### - **Data**: Administrative data on more than 18 million voters in Ohio and North Carolina with deed-level data on property ownership.
##### - **Statistical Procedure**: Two versions
- Individual level difference-in-difference design: compare individuals who buy homes of similar prices at different times
- Stronger DID design: synthetic matching approach where exactly matching individuals based on their turnout in four pre-treatment electoral cycles

##### Measurement Validity
##### - **Interpretation**: Discuss how measurements relate to theoretical constructs.
##### - **Argument**: Provide justification for the measurement choices.

##### Substantive Identification
##### - **Assumption**: List the key assumptions underlying the empirical analysis.
##### - **Arguments**: Critically evaluate the validity of these assumptions.

##### Confidence Building
##### Discuss robustness checks and alternative specifications to support findings.

#### 2. Commensurability
##### Discuss how different models and empirical strategies can be compared.

#### 3. Reinterpretation
##### Provide alternative interpretations of the findings.

#### 4. Elaborating
##### Expand on how the literature review contributes to future research.
- Multiple Design?: two different DID designs and the similar estimate leading to implication

#### References
##### List all references in a consistent and proper citation style.

#### Memo
- Found that (theory focuses on local policy) becoming a homeowner increases the propensity to participate in national elections.
-> homeownership causes a more general shift in individuals' attention
