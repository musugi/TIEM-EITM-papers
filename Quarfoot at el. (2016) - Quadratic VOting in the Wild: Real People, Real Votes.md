#### 0. Introduction
This paper makes an evaluation on quadratic voting (QV) approached opinion measurement.

#### 1. Targets
**Common Target**: QV-based instrument provides a clearer measure of the preferences of the most intensely motivated respondents
**Targets of Model**: QV satisfies IC, thus, enables voters to reveal their preferences truthfully.
**Targets of Research Design**: QV successfully creates a scarcity mindset relative to Likert

#### 1. Elements of Framework
#### Theory
**Similarities of Model to the Target**: N/A

**Model**: QV differentiates itself from Likert-based scales
- QV Model: The system gives voters strong incentives to truthfully reveal their preferences (IC), while maintaining the maximizing public welfare (Weyl, 2012). QV forces the marginal cost of voting to be proportional to the number of votes purchased, and thus, creates an efficient space in which voting is proportional to value.

**Implication**: 
- Survey satisfaction
- Key threat to the continued value of survey research

#### Empirical/Elements of Research Design (ERD)
#### Empirical Strategy
**Estimand**: 
- Macro (all) and micro (average) level differences in the distribution of response between Likert and QV voters
- The effect of voting methodologies in supporting "clustering practice"
- predictive powers of the two methodologies

**Data**: Response of 4850 individuals whom they passed the "screening" and whose demographics are well aligned with those of the United States, who were assigned to one of three categories: Likert, QV, Likert-QV. The following is the experimental design in collecting data:
1. All three subsets of respondents were asked to express the same 10 policy proposals; asked to respond in three different way.
2. Completion of tasks, participants were requested to provide their demographics and survey feedback (follow-up questions)
In addition, software captured metadata (e.g. movement during survey section, time spent/lapsing)

**Statistical Procedure**:
Comparison of Likert and QV in regards:
- voting distribution (third moment), time spent, number of voting action, numbers and types of revisions, accumulating vote trajectories​
- revision tendency, mean z-score for a given proposal of vote intensity, percentages of voters casting strong votes​
- probability that participants ask for more information on policy issues

#### Measurement Validity
**Interpretation**:
- The collected data gives meaningful comparisons of responses between two methods.

**Argument**:
- The demographic summary of all three groups was similar.
- The experiment is designed to maximize the completion rate by keeping surveys simple and short: completion rates were closely identical among all three.

#### Substantive Identification
**Assumption**:
- The response distributions between Likert-only and QV-only participants are comparable by the third moments.

**Arguments**:
- The demographics among the participants of each methods are similar. 

#### Confidence Building


#### 2. Commensurability
- Empirical findings speak to both implications and discussion of mechanisms that lead to establishing QV as a promising alternative survey tool for political and commercial research. ("If the theory of QV is valid, then respondents should be given strong incentives to reveal their truthful preferences").
- Yes..., the implication of the model is that QV enables truthful reporting of voter preferences, and the paper sort of commensurates the implication to the comparison result (Likert vs. QV) which demonstrates the quasi-normal (laptokurtic) distribution; high-level thoughtfulness; attenuates extremism; and predicts behavior better. Yet, the model does not directly work on deciphering if QV actually enables voter's truthful report.

#### 3. Reinterpretation

#### 4. Elaboration  
- The results extrapolates theoretical target; the research suggests that QV encourage voters to deliberate on their voting actions which is slightly off of the model's target.

#### Memo
- I was not quite sure what "single and dual methodology test condition" which the paper claims the differences revealed in revision are inherent to the methodologies, and not to the voting sample.
